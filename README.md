# 🩺 Blockchain Medical Records System

A decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum to securely manage and store patient medical records, including personal information, health data, diagnosis history, and lab test results. Doctors can be authorized to add medical records, while patients retain control over their own data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Store and update **patient basic information**
- Record **health data** such as height, weight, blood type, and medical history
- Add and view **diagnosis history**
- Add and view **lab test results**
- **Doctor authorization system** managed by the contract owner
- Ether-based payment system for data submission
- Frontend integration with **Web3.js**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Solidity** (`^0.8.17`) – Smart contract language
- **Ethereum / Hardhat** – Blockchain environment
- **Web3.js** – Frontend-to-blockchain communication
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – UI for interacting with the smart contract
